# Pet/CT Superresolution and Tumor Synthesis Project

This project aims to address the issue of low resolution in the CT portion of Pet/CT images. Specifically, we perform tumor synthesis based on the Pet signal to enhance the CT image and subsequently upsample it to create CT images at the level commonly used in medical imaging.

## Key Steps:

1. **Preprocessing for CT Resolution Enhancement:**
   - Preprocess the CT image using the Pet signal to compensate for its low resolution.

2. **Tumor Synthesis:**
   - Synthesize tumors onto the CT image based on the Pet signal obtained from the Pet/CT images.

3. **High-Resolution CT Image Generation:**
   - Upsample the synthesized CT image to a higher resolution to improve the quality of medical imaging.

## Code and Usage:

The code for this project is documented step by step in the 'inference2.ipynb' file. Empty code sections will be filled in later, and code explanations are kept as simple as possible.

## Note:

- This project is developed for research purposes in the field of medical imaging, specifically focusing on CT image resolution enhancement and tumor synthesis using Pet signals.
